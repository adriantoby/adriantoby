# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Adrian
## About Me
I'm a third year Computer Science major at the University of Florida. In my free time, I love to journal about my day and have been journaling for nearly 7 years. I also love music, with my favorite instrument to play being the guitar. I love teaching others about programming and would love to learn new tools I can learn and master! I am interested in full stack development using tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and am looking forward to learning new tools like React.
